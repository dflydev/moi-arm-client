Development

### Composer

The preferred method to develop for this library or test it out is to use
[Composer](https://getcomposer.org/).

If you need Composer:

    curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
    php composer.phar install

If you have Composer:

    composer install


### Without Composer

If you do not have Composer, you can use this library using any PSR-4
autoloader. Map the `Moi\Arm\Client` namespace to the base directory
`src/Moi/Arm/Client`.

 * `Moi\Arm\Client` => `src/Moi/Arm/Client`


Examples
--------

To run the example code, copy `examples/config.json.sample` to
`examples/config.json` and change values where required. The username and
password configuration settings are probably the only things that need to be
changed.

Once this file is created, you can run the simple example:

    php examples/simple-example.php
